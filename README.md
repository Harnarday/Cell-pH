# boringCellpH

Repository for code relating to a simple model to look at internal cell pH. The model describes a protocell with 50% of its membrane in contact with the internal alkaline fluid of the vent, and 50% of its membrane in contact with the vent wall (i.e. in contact with the acidic ocean).
